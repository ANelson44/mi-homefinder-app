# National Park Explorer
A collaborative effort to make an application that gives information about a searched state's national parks.

## User story
As a user, I want to be able to view a state's national parks and information about the park such as what there is to do, the amenities, and what the park looks like. Useful for all kinds of people: travellers, students, etc.

## How to Use
To use the national park explorer, just search a state up by its abbreviation and hit enter or the search button to explore its national parks! 

## Technologies Used
We used a varity of technologies for this project. In our JavaScript, we used the National Parks Service API as well as OpenStreetMaps API. For CSS, we used Tailwind CSS as well as just traditional CSS. In our HTML, we used FontAwesome for icons. 

## Challenges and Future Features
Our original idea was to use the Zillow API to create a homefinder, however we were unable to get access to an API key without getting through a paywall. Accessing the NPS API was much easier, and once we got started with using the API it was not too difficult at all. Another challenge we ran into was the NPS' lack of information. We wanted to add a sidebar that allowed for users to customize the information they received (RV parking, amenities, etc.) but there was not enough variety of information to grab. In the future, we would like to add some sort of sidebar like we intended that allows some sort of customization.
